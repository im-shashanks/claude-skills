# Seeded anti-patterns — failure patterns from prior stories
# Used by dev test to verify memory-driven development
anti_patterns:
  - id: AP-001
    failed_approach: "Returning raw database errors (e.g., IntegrityError, OperationalError) directly in API responses"
    failure_mode: "Leaks internal implementation details to clients and makes error handling inconsistent across endpoints"
    severity: P1
    recommended_approach: "Catch database exceptions in the service layer, map them to domain-specific errors, and return standardized error responses from the API layer"
    trigger_patterns: [database, error, exception, api, response, integrity]
