# Deep Analysis Workflow — Team-Based Execution

Reference file for `/shaktra:analyze` deep mode. When agent teams are available, the orchestrator delegates to this workflow. Produces the same artifact schemas as standard mode, with richer data from dedicated team member sessions and cross-cutting correlations.

**Used by:** shaktra-analyze SKILL.md (deep mode delegation).
**Prerequisites:** Agent teams available, Stage 1 (static.yml + overview.yml) complete, settings loaded.

## Stage 2: Spawn Team (4 Members)

Use TeamCreate to spawn a team of 4 agents simultaneously. Each team member spawns up to 3 subagents for its dimensions. In every prompt below, replace `{project_root}` with the actual project root path and `{skill_directory}` with the absolute path to this skill's directory.

### TM-1: "structure" — D1, D5, D9

**Dimensions:** D1 Architecture & Structure, D5 Dependencies & Tech Stack, D9 Git Intelligence
**Writes:** `structure.yml`, `dependencies.yml`, `git-intelligence.yml`, `tm1-summary.md`

**Prompt template:**
```

CONTEXT:
- Pre-analysis ground truth: {project_root}/.shaktra/analysis/static.yml
- Project context: {project_root}/.shaktra/analysis/overview.yml
- Memory (if exists): {project_root}/.shaktra/memory/principles.yml, anti-patterns.yml, procedures.yml

DIMENSION SPECS (read the relevant sections):
- D1: {skill_directory}/analysis-dimensions-core.md → section "D1: Architecture & Structure"
- D5: {skill_directory}/analysis-dimensions-health.md → section "D5: Dependencies & Tech Stack"
- D9: {skill_directory}/analysis-dimensions-git.md → section "D9: Git Intelligence"

1. Read static.yml and overview.yml for ground truth
2. Spawn 3 CBA Analyzer subagents in parallel — one per dimension. Each subagent prompt must include the full paths above for its dimension spec, output schema, and output file.
3. After all complete, validate: every artifact has summary: within budget, all findings cite evidence from actual files
4. Write tm1-summary.md to {project_root}/.shaktra/analysis/ — max 500 words
   Key findings, structural risks, git intelligence highlights

DO NOT: Write to files owned by other TMs. Modify static.yml or overview.yml. Fabricate file paths or evidence.
```

### TM-2: "domain" — D2, D3 + error propagation correlation

**Dimensions:** D2 Domain Model & Business Rules, D3 Entry Points & Interfaces
**Writes:** `domain-model.yml`, `entry-points.yml`, `tm2-summary.md`

2. Spawn 2 CBA Analyzer subagents in parallel — D4 and D7. Each subagent prompt must include the full paths above.
3. After both complete, run test intelligence correlation: review D4 test patterns alongside data-flows for deeper test quality analysis. Ensure violation_catalog in practices.yml captures all convention deviations found.
4. Validate: every artifact has summary: within budget, all findings cite evidence from actual files
5. Write tm4-summary.md to {project_root}/.shaktra/analysis/ — max 500 words

```

---

## Stage 3: Aggregate (Lead)

After all 4 team members complete:

1. **Read summaries:** Load `tm1-summary.md` through `tm4-summary.md` (~2000 words total). This is ALL the lead reads from team member output.

2. **Validate artifacts (for each dimension artifact):**
   - **Parse check** — confirm valid YAML
   - **Summary check** — `summary:` is first key with substantive content (not a placeholder)
   - **Schema check** — all required top-level keys from `analysis-output-schemas.md` present
   - **File reference spot-check** — extract 5 random file paths from `details:`, verify each exists with Glob. If >1 fails, mark dimension as `failed`
   - **Evidence density check** — confirm no major section has zero evidence citations
   - If any artifact fails, report which dimensions need re-execution

3. **Fallback cross-cutting risk:** If `critical-paths.yml` does not contain a `cross_cutting_risk` section (TM-3 Agent C may have failed or git data was unavailable), compute it now: read `tech-debt.yml`, `critical-paths.yml`, and `git-intelligence.yml` (if available). Append `cross_cutting_risk` to `critical-paths.yml` under `details:`.

4. **Generate checksums:** Compute SHA256 of all analyzed source files. Map each file to dimensions. Write to `checksum.yml`.

5. **Generate Mermaid diagrams:** Read `structure.yml`, generate architecture diagram, include under `diagrams:` key.

6. **Update manifest:** Set all dimensions to `complete`, record completion timestamp, set `execution_mode: deep`.

After Stage 3 completes, return to SKILL.md and continue with Step 5.

## Common Constraints

All team members and their subagents must follow:

- **Write only own files** — see ownership map above
- **Analyze all source files** — use static.yml file inventory as the complete scope, not a subset
- **Evidence required** — every finding must cite file:line, code pattern, or tool output. Minimum 3 evidence citations per analysis category. If fewer exist, cite all and note the limited sample.
- **Summary budgets respected** — per `analysis-output-schemas.md` budget table. Summaries must be substantive and use a significant portion of their budget — thin summaries miss context that downstream agents need.
- **No hallucinated paths** — every file path in output must exist (verify with Glob/Read)
- **Canonical examples are real** — code snippets copied from actual codebase, not generated. Must be 10-40 lines. Never paraphrase or summarize code.
- **Absence is valid** — if a dimension has no findings (e.g., no tests exist), document the absence rather than fabricating content
- **Detect project-specific patterns** — beyond standard conventions, identify patterns unique to this codebase (e.g., lazy loading, fail-closed validation, shared helpers)
- **Cross-file analysis** — compare how different parts of the codebase handle the same concern. Look for duplicated functions across files. Report inconsistencies across directories.
- **Self-check before writing** — verify you analyzed files from multiple directories, canonical examples are real code >10 lines, summaries are substantive, and violation catalogs cover mixed/low consistency areas

## Team Summary Persistence

Team summaries (`tm1-summary.md` through `tm4-summary.md`) persist in `.shaktra/analysis/` after aggregation. They are useful for debugging the analysis process itself and have negligible cost.
