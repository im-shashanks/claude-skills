## Plugin Structure

Shaktra is a Claude Code **plugin** distributed via GitHub. Users install with `/plugin install shaktra@marketplace`. The repo follows the official plugin layout:

```
shaktra-plugin/

```

**Key structural rules:**
- `.claude-plugin/` contains `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
- Everything else (agents, skills, hooks) lives at the **plugin root**, not inside `.claude/`
- Skills are namespaced as `/shaktra:skill-name` when installed
- Agents are available to the plugin's skills via the Task tool
- **Main agent skills must NOT use `context: fork`** — they run inline in the main conversation to spawn sub-agents via Task tool
- **Sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents** — orchestrator skills handle all coordination, sub-agents execute and return
- **Plugins are cached after install** — all internal paths must use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (e.g., hook scripts)
- **Agent `skills` frontmatter** — agents declare which internal skills to preload via the `skills` field in YAML frontmatter

## Target Project Structure (after init)

When a user runs `/shaktra:init` in their project, this hidden directory is created:

```
user-project/
└── .shaktra/                   # Hidden — framework-managed workspace
    ├── settings.yml            # Framework configuration (from template)
    ├── memory/
    │   ├── decisions.yml       # Architectural decisions (append-only)
    │   ├── lessons.yml         # Lessons learned (append-only, max 100)
    │   └── sprints.yml         # Sprint planning state
    ├── stories/                # Story YAML files (ST-001.yml, etc.)
    ├── designs/                # Design documents
    ├── analysis/               # Codebase analysis output (brownfield)
    └── .tmp/                   # Per-story working state (always gitignored)
        └── {story-id}/
            ├── handoff.yml     # TDD phase state machine
            └── implementation_plan.md
```

**Why hidden (`.shaktra/` not `shaktra/`):** The framework is a creation tool, not a storage system. Teammates who don't use Shaktra never need to know about it. Gitignore flexibility:
- `.shaktra/` — ignore everything (solo use)
- `.shaktra/.tmp/` — ignore only ephemeral state (commit artifacts)
- Selective — mix and match

`/shaktra:init` adds `.shaktra/.tmp/` to `.gitignore` by default.

## Token Budget

| Context | Lines | Est. Tokens | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Always loaded (CLAUDE.md) | ~30 | ~500 | Plugin identity, available commands |
| Main agent skill | ~250 | ~3,500 | Orchestration logic |
| Sub-agent definition | ~80 | ~1,200 | Persona + role + constraints |
| Internal skill (loaded by agent) | ~200 | ~3,000 | Deep knowledge, loaded on-demand |
| Reference skill (shared constants) | ~150 | ~2,000 | Severity, tokens, principles |
| **Typical workflow step** | **~710** | **~10,000** | Main skill + 1 sub-agent + skills |
| **Maximum single step** | **~960** | **~14,000** | All skills loaded simultaneously |
| **Forge equivalent** | **22,000+** | **150,000+** | For comparison |

**Result:** ~93% reduction in per-step token consumption vs Forge.

### Token Optimization Strategy

Optimization is **architectural, not format-based**. YAML and Markdown remain the standard formats — human readability, reliable parsing, and schema validation outweigh marginal token savings from compact formats.

**Architectural optimization principles:**

1. **Selective loading** — Load only the files relevant to the current operation
2. **Progressive depth** — Sub-agents receive only the context they need
3. **On-demand skill loading** — Internal skills load when their consumer agent is spawned, not upfront
4. **Reference sub-file splitting** — shaktra-reference split into sub-files so agents load only relevant sections
5. **No tier-aware content reduction** — All quality checks (~35) always loaded regardless of story tier
6. **Batch summaries** — When loading multiple stories, use summary views rather than full story content

**What these principles do NOT mean:**
- Do NOT compress or abbreviate skill instructions to save tokens
- Do NOT skip loading reference material
- Do NOT reduce agent persona depth

### Static Knowledge Files (Best Practices & Patterns)

| Skill | File | Loaded By | Content |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| shaktra-tdd | testing-practices.md | test-agent, sw-engineer | Behavioral testing, test isolation, mocking discipline |
| shaktra-tdd | coding-practices.md | developer, sw-engineer | Implementation patterns, error handling, anti-patterns |
| shaktra-quality | quick-check.md | sw-quality, tpm-quality | ~35 quality checks organized by severity and gate |
| shaktra-quality | comprehensive-review.md | sw-quality, cr-analyzer | Full 13-dimension review template |
| shaktra-reference | quality-principles.md | All agents | 10 core quality principles |
| shaktra-reference | quality-dimensions.md | Quality agents | 13 review dimensions (A-M) |
| shaktra-stories | story-creation.md | scrummaster | Story crafting rules, enrichment rules, tier detection |

**Key rules:** Language-agnostic. Selective loading. Ported from Forge with scrutiny.

**Gap:** Architect agent has no architecture patterns knowledge file. Evaluate during Phase 4.

## Design Constraints

Non-negotiable rules for every phase:

| # | Constraint | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | No single file over 300 lines | Forge analysis 9.5 |
| 2 | No content duplication across layers | Forge analysis 9.5 |
| 3 | No dead code, disabled stubs, or orphaned files | Forge analysis 9.5 |
| 4 | No features advertised but not implemented | Forge analysis 9.5 |
| 5 | P0-P3 severity defined in exactly ONE file | Forge analysis 9.4 #6 |
| 6 | Guard tokens reduced to ~15 (from Forge's 40+) | Forge analysis 9.4 #7 |
| 7 | Hooks enforce or don't exist — no warn-only | Forge analysis 9.5 |
| 8 | All hook scripts in Python — cross-platform | Forge analysis 9.3 |
| 9 | Full persona descriptions for all agents | User decision |
| 10 | Full sprint planning with velocity tracking | User decision |
| 11 | SW Quality (story-level) separate from Code Reviewer (app-level) | User decision |
| 12 | Quality depth and breadth must match or exceed Forge | User requirement |

## Agent Design Philosophy — Domain Expertise

Each main workflow pillar is a **Subject Matter Expert**. They do one thing and do it exceptionally well.

**What this means in practice:**
- When building each workflow, assemble it with **industry-standard best practices**, tooling, and deep domain knowledge
- A TPM workflow should rival a seasoned Principal Program Manager
- An SDM workflow should rival a senior Dev Lead
- A Code Reviewer should rival a Principal Engineer
- A Codebase Analyzer should rival a Staff Engineer during due diligence

**How this guides implementation:**
- Each agent's skill content is written as if training a world-class practitioner
- Sub-agents inherit their parent workflow's domain depth
- Internal skills encode hard-won domain knowledge
- No agent tries to be good at everything — they defer to the appropriate expert

**Cross-workflow collaboration:** When a workflow encounters something outside its expertise, it escalates rather than attempting it. SDM escalates story quality to TPM. Code Reviewer escalates architecture concerns to TPM.
